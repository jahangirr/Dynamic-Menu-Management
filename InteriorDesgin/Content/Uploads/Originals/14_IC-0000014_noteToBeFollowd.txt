 1.  To have the intellisence of the concerned item on SPR , first of all , Item Status on the specified date needs to see.
 2.  Users are not allowed to do spr or indent having different item . If they do , at the time of doing PO , if any item of the SPR or Indent is left ,
 it will get another PO as PO being generated automatically sequencially which would be the cause of having single SPR in Multiple PO , However, getting sure of doing 
PO based on all the items that usually be with the same SPR OR Indent at a time , User is allowed.
